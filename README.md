## User Experience
### Strategy

The website is a business to customer (B2C) website that sells digital products (digital copies of their art). Depending on the customer's choice of graphic design, they can be downloaded to use for things like profile images, inspiration, use with their own business, or just print off and hang somewhere. 

The target audience are:

- Graphic designers
- Web developers
- Aged 21 and over working professionals

Considering all that, I believe the customers will require a website that is able to:

- Navigate easily
- Sort and search capability
- Send emails
- Request quotes
- Allow users to make an account and view their orders
- Allow users to  rate or review products

## Agile
The Epics and User stories were created using the issues feature on GitHub. The Epics are treated as milestones and the User stories were each labeled using the MoSCoW method. These were then added to a Basic Kanban using the GitHub projects feature. Each user story was placed initially in the **To do** column, then added to the **In progress** column when it was being implemented to the project. The user stories were updated as the project progressed and users stories were added to the done column when completed.

Most of the user stories have been completed except for the following:
- Social media signup (Could-Have)
- Watermark images (Could-Have)

They have since been placed in the **Backlog** column, as they could not be completed in this iteration of the project due to time constraints, but may eventually get completed in the next iteration of the project.
