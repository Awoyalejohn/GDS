## User Experience
### Strategy

The website is a business to customer (B2C) website that sells digital products (digital copies of their art). Depending on the customer's choice of graphic design, they can be downloaded to use for things like profile images, inspiration, use with their own business, or just print off and hang somewhere. 

The target audience are:

- Graphic designers
- Web developers
- Aged 21 and over working professionals

Considering all that, I believe the customers will require a website that is able to:

- Navigate easily
- Sort and search capability
- Send emails
- Request quotes
- Allow users to make an account and view their orders
- Allow users to  rate or review products

## Agile
The Epics and User stories were created using the issues feature on GitHub. The Epics are treated as milestones and the User stories were each labeled using the MoSCoW method. These were then added to a Basic Kanban using the GitHub projects feature. Each user story was placed initially in the **To do** column, then added to the **In progress** column when it was being implemented to the project. The user stories were updated as the project progressed and users stories were added to the done column when completed.

Most of the user stories have been completed except for the following:
- Social media signup (Could-Have)
- Watermark images (Could-Have)

They have since been placed in the **Backlog** column, as they could not be completed in this iteration of the project due to time constraints, but may eventually get completed in the next iteration of the project.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

1. Error message when using the runserver command during development deploy: `Invalid HTTP_HOST header: '127.0.0.1:8000'. You may need to add '127.0.0.1' to ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
    - Adding the host header shown in the warning to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in the settings.py file.
2. Horizontal overflow on footer which was being caused by the size of the bootstrap grid gaps.
    - Reducing the size of the grid gaps from (gy-4 gx-5) to (gy-3 gx-4).
3. Product list page images overflowing out of card body.
    - Adding a max width of a 100% to the images.
4. Products would show when I tried to sort the products by category because product categories were named with capital letters.
    - Using the slug of the category to sort with instead since they always lowercase
5. Could not delete items form cart initially, beacue forgot to add csrf token.
    - Added csrf token.
6. Quote request images would not save to the website of database, because forgot to add the enctype="multipart/form-data” attribute to the form
    - Added enctype="multipart/form-data” attribute to the form.
7. Could not add items to the cart after adding the Wishlist functionality. The same name was used to add items form the wishlist to the cart "add_to_cart".
    - Change the name for the wish list version to “add_to_cart_from_wishlist”.

### Unsolved Bugs

1. On the recently viewed products section of the product list, when you go to the same page as the most recent product added to the recently view section it will only show 4 items instead of 5.
2. Custom clearable file input doesn’t display the template used to make the from look better.

13. Type in your python version for Heroku in the runtime.txt file
    
    ```
    python-3.8.10
    ```
    
14. Create a new Django Project
    
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject <projectName .>
    ```
    
15. Create a gitignore file
    
    ```bash
    touch .gitignore
    ```
    
16. Add these files and folders to the gitignore file
    
    ```
    core.Microsoft*
    core.mongo*
    core.python*
    env.py
    __pycache__/
    *.py[cod]
    node_modules/
    .github/
    *.sqlite3
    *.pyc
    .venv
    ```
    
17. Run the project to make sure everything is working.
    
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
    
18. Run the initial migrations
    
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
    
19. Create a super user to log into the admin
    
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    
20. Add, commit, and push to GitHub 
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git push 
    ```
    
21. Now signup or log into Heroku to create the app
22. Create a new app on Heroku by clicking the “Create new app” button
23. Go to the resources tab
24. Search for  “Heroku Postgres”
25. Click the “submit order” form button
26. Go to the settings tab
27. Click on the reveal Config Vars button
28. Copy the Postgres URL value to the right of the Database_url key
29. Go back to the Django project on the code editor
30. Create an env.py file
    
    ```bash
    touch env.py
    ```
    
31. Add environment variables for the database and secret key inside the env.py file.
    
    ```python
    import os
    
    os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "<database url>"
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<secret key>"
    ```
    
32. Go back to Heroku website and copy the key and value of the secret key and paste it into config vars on Heroku then click add.
33. Then in the Django project on the code editor go to the settings.py file.
34. Add these imports at the top of the settings.py file.
    
    ```python
    from pathlib import Path
    import os
    import dj_database_url
    if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
        import env
    ```
    
35. Then go to the insecure SECRET-KEY in settings.py  and change its value to target the secret key in the env.py file instead.
    
    ```python
    SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
    ```
    
36. Then go down to the database section in settings.py file. Add a conditional if statement to use the Postgres database if it is available and if it is not use the default sqlite3 database.
    
    ```python
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.getenv('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
    ```
    
37. Now you need to migrate changes again
    
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
    
38. Then go to Heroku app and click the resources tab
39. Then click on the Heroku Postgres add-on to check that the database is working.
40. Now create a templates folders
    
    ```bash
    mkdir static templates
    ```
    
41. Now you need to tell Django where the templates will be stored.
42. Back to the top of settings.py file in the base directory section. Add the templates directory variable.
    
    ```python
    # Build paths inside the project like this: BASE_DIR / 'subdir'.
    BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
    TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
    ```
    
43. Then go to the middle section in settings.py you need to find the templates list and add TEMPLATES_DIR to the DIRS KEY in the dictionary.
    
    ```python
    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
            'APP_DIRS': True,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                    'django.template.context_processors.request',
                    'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                    'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
                ],
            },
        },
    ]
    ```
    
44. Add the Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps in settings.py and make sure that `cloudinary_storage` is before `django.contrib.staticfiles`
    
    ```python
    # Application definition
    
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'cloudinary_storage',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'django.contrib.sites',
        'cloudinary',
    ]
    ```
    
45. Now you need to tell Django to use Cloudinary to store the media and static files.
46. Create the static and media folders
    
    ```bash
    mkdir static media
    ```
    
47. Go to the static files section that is near the end of the settings.py file. Then add the directories for the static and media folders
    
    ```python
    # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
    # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/static-files/
    
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),]
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
    ```
    
48. Now go to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in the settings.py file and add the Heroku app and HTTP_HOST header
    
    ```python
    # SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
    DEBUG = True
    
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['graphics-design-space.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ```
    
49. Then create a “Procfile” 
    
    ```bash
    touch Procfile
    ```
    
50. Add this text into the Procfile
    
    ```python
    web: gunicorn <projectName>.wsgi
    ```
    
51. Then we deploy to Heroku
52. Open the terminal and log into Heroku (might have to restart terminal)
    
    ```bash
    heroku login -i
    ```
    
53. Find your app name
    
    ```bash
    heroku apps
    ```
    
54. Set the heroku remote using your app name 
    
    ```bash
    heroku git:remote -a <app_name>
    ```
    
55. Disable collect static so Heroku won’t try to collect static files when you deploy
    
    ```bash
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <app-name>
    ```
    
56. Add and commit any changes to your code if applicable
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    
    git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"
    ```
    
57. Push to both GitHub and Heroku
    
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    
    git push heroku main
    ```
### Production
1. Go to the settings.py file and set DEBUG to True
    
    ```python
    DEBUG = TRUE
    ```
    
2. Then you save all files and commit then push to GitHub
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "commit message"
    git push
    ```
    
3. Then head over to your Heroku app on the Heroku website.
4. Go to settings reveal config vars then remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable
5. Then deploy to Heroku
6. Open the terminal.
    
    ```bash
    command: heroku login -i
    ```
    
7. Get your app name from Heroku.
    
    ```bash
    heroku apps
    ```
    
8. Set the Heroku remote. (Replace <app_name> with your actual app name and remove the <> characters)
    
    ```bash
    heroku git:remote -a <app_name>
    ```
    
9. Add and commit any changes to your code if applicable
    
    ```bash
    command: git add . && git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"
    ```
    
10. Push to both GitHub and Heroku
    
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    git push heroku main
    ```
